#The problem is from http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2013/02/more-maths-madness.html
#This problem is apparently known as "Impossible Puzzle" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Puzzle )
#The problem is as following:
#Both x and y are integer which satisfy 1 < x < y < 100
#Sam knows the value of x+y
#Peter knows the value of x*y
#Sam knows that Peter knows the value of x*y
#Peter knows that Sam knows the value of x+y

#They did the following conversation:
#Peter: I cannot determine the 2 numbers
#Sam: I know that (you don't know the 2 numbers)
#Peter: Now I can determine them
#Sam: So can I



#Solution explanation:
#Essentially, every statement in the conversation is new information used to eliminate some of the possibilities
#Let's say, x = 4 and y = 13
#Peter knows x*y=52 and Sam knows x+y=17
#What Peter is knowing now is that, the by now possible answers are [2, 26] and [4, 13]
#What Sam is knowing now is that, the by now possible answers are [2, 15], [3, 14], [4, 13], [5, 12], [6, 11], [7, 10], [8, 9]
#After each statement, both Peter and Sam will examine their possible answers against ALL previously stated statements
